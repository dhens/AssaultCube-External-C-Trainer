# AssaultCube-External-C++-Trainer

## Motivation
After completing the bootcamp, I wanted to have a project that was entirely built by me, from the ground up, with no guidelines or rubrics. 

## Goals
* Gain a better understanding of lower-level programming languages
* See how a computer actually works by examining how memory is allocated, used, and modified during runtime
* Be able to modify any stat in the game as I see fit without having to manually search for a memory address every time I restart the game.

## Outcome
